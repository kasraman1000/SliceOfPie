Der var engang en dreng der hed Birger.\n
Birger var en rigtig dum dreng og blev drillet i skolen.\n
Det var der også god grund til fordi han var nemlig født med et mentalt handicap.\n
Birger døde desværre i en meget voldelig sneboldskamp i skolen.\n
Men det var nok for det bedre :)

Det var der også god grund til fordi han var nemlig født med et mentalt handicap og lav højde.\n

Jeg vil gerne MEGET snart spille computer.\n
Det måtte gerne være et teamspil hvis det er. \n

Some of the things that are always hard, when doing usability tests on random persons, are to not make them feel stupid. If we give them a task which wouldn’t be that easy to solve as the first task, or a task which our program handles badly the test-person might feel stupid, but what we really want them to think is that the problem is the program and not their effort, that doesn’t get the job done.\n
That is why we have encouraged all our test-persons to read the user manual thoroughly, as well as test out the program a bit before starting with the task list.\n
We picked our test-persons, by going around on the university and talk to different kind of people at different stages of their education, to get some variation. As well as the students we found at the university we also tried to talk some of our family members which are of an entirely different target market, again to give us larger variation.
